            <p>My name is Brady King. I was born and raised in Mesa, Arizona. I attended Mountain View Highschool and graduated
                    in 2012. I have worked various jobs and gone to school for a few years, hoping to find something I wanted
                    to pursue.I have worked in sales and recently have become interested in computers, and I realized that although
                    I don't love sales, the idea of running a business is intriguing.</p>
                <p>This is what has brought me to the bootcamp. I hope to acquire the skills necessary to succeed in this rapidly
                    changing world. By combining these two worlds, I feel that I can accomplish a great deal in my life.</p>
                <p>In my spare time I like to game a little bit with my friends on my desktop that I built over the winter. I also
                    am a huge sports fan. I played them all throughout highschool and frequently watch football, basketball,
                    and baseball whenever I can catch a game.</p>
